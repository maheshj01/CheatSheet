/* To Create A Database */

   create database database_name;

/* create a table*/

   create Table table_name(
    	attribute_name  type,
	attribute_name  type,
	attribute_name  type,
	Primary KEY(attribute_name); /*(optional) */
   );

e.g create Table customers(
	id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
	firstName VARCHAR(100),
	lastName VARCHAR(100),
	zipcode VARCHAR(10)
	Primary KEY(id); 
    );

/* Inserting a single Row into database */

   Insert into table_name(attributes,attributes,....) VALUES('value1','value2',....);

e.g
   Insert into customers(firstName,lastName,zipcode) VALUES('John','Doe','345333');

/* Inserting Multiple Rows into the Database */
 
  Insert into customers(firstName,lastName,zipcode) VALUES
  ('James','Bond','35333'); /* Row 1*/
  ('John','Cena','355333'); /* Row 2*/
  ('Sam','Page','365333'); /* Row 3*/
  ('Larry','Page','365233'); /* Row 4*/


/* Update a row in the database */

   Update table_name
   SET attribute = 'value'
   Where condition;

   Note: if we dont specify where statement the update is applied to all the rows in 
      the database

  e.g to change the last name of person with id = 3 

   Update customers
   SET last = 'Billings'
   Where id = 3;

  /* delete a row */

  DELETE from customers
  where id =3;	

  /* ALTER TABLE */

  1. Used to modify the schema of the table like add/delete column

  /* To add a column into the existing table using Alter table query */

  ALTER table customers ADD email int(100);		

  /* To Change datatype of existing column*/
   
   ALTER table customers
   MODIFY COLUMN email VARCHAR(100);

  /* To drop existing column */
   
  ALTER TABLE customers DROP COLUMN email;


  /* SELECT STATEMENT TO RETRIEVE DATA*/

  1. To retrieve all data
 
   SELECT * from customers;

  2. To retrieve limited or specific Columns	

   SELECT firstName, lastName from customers

  3. TO select specific row from table

   SELECT * from customers where id = 3;

  4. To order/sort data by Last Name

   SELECT * from customers ORDER BY lastName;	
	
  5  To sort by DESCENDING use DESC and ASC for Ascending
   
   SELECT * from customers ORDER BY lastName DESC; 		

 /* To select all unique firstnames from the database or avoids duplicate occurences */

   SELECT DISTINCT firstName from customers;
	
********************************************* SQL OPERATORS ************************************************

1. =         ---> equal to    
2. <>        ---> not equal to
3. >         ---> greater than
4. <         ---> less than
5. >=        ---> greater than or equal to
6. <=        ---> less than or equal to
7. BETWEEN   ---> between an inclusive range  e.g SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id Between 1 AND 3;
8. LIKE      ---> to match a pattern or used in searching  e.g SELECT * FROM customers WHERE firstName like '%n'; /*firstname ending with n*/
9. IS OR IS NOT  ---> 	compare to null (missing data)
10. IS NOT DISTINCT FROM ---> is equal to value or both are nulls
11. AS  	----> used to change a field name when viewing results
12. IN 		----> equal to one of multiple possible values e.g SELECT * from customers WHERE state IN ('New York','Massachusetts');  
**************************************************************************************************************************************
					Indexes
1. To query data faster and efficiently

 CREATE INDEX nameindex ON customers(firstName);

 DROP INDEX nameindex ON customers;

*********************************************************************************************************************************************
					JOINS 
1. To combine two or more rows based on some common field between the tables
	
   types of joins
	a) Inner Join
	b) LEFT JOIN
	c) Right Join
	d) Full Join

1. Inner Join -- returns data from both tables when there is match of specific field

e.g SELECT customers.firstName,customers.lastName,orders.orderNumber
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders
ON customers.id = orders.orderId
ORDER BY orders.orderNumber

2.LEFT JOIN-- returns data from the LEFT TABLE with matching rows from Right table
e.g SELECT customers.firstName,customers.lastName,orders.orderNumber,orders.orderDate
from customers
LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customerId
ORDER BY customers.lastName

CITY		VARCHAR2(21)
STATE		VARCHAR2(2)
LAT_N		NUMBER
LONG_W		NUMBER


1.American Cities with population greater than 100000
SELECT * FROM CITY WHERE COUNTRYCODE=USA and POPULATION >100000

2.Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths 
(i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, 
choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

SELECT CITY,LENGTH(CITY)
FROM STATION
ORDER BY Length(CITY) ASC ,
CITY ASC LIMIT 1;
SELECT CITY,LENGTH(CITY)
FROM STATION
ORDER BY Length(CITY) DESC ,
CITY DESC LIMIT 1;

3.Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. 
Your result cannot contain duplicates.

SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE SUBSTRING(CITY,1,1) IN ('a','e','i','o','u');

Note: SUBSTRING(CITY,1,1) CREATES a substring for city from index 1 to 1

or Using Regex

SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE CITY REGEXP "^[aeiou]";

Note: ^ cap denotes beginning with and [] indicates one of a,e,i,o,u

4. Distinct CITY ending with vowels

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE CITY REGEXP "[aeiou]$"

or

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE SUBSTRING(CITY,length(CITY),length(CITY)) IN('a','e','i','o','u');

5. City Begining and ending with Vowels

select distinct city from station 
where left(city,1) in ('a','e','i','o','u') 
and right(city, 1) in ('a','e','i','o','u')

or

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE CITY REGEXP "^[aeiou].*[aeiou]$"

or

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE SUBSTRING(CITY,1,1) IN ('a','e','i','o','u') and SUBSTRING(CITY,length(CITY),length(CITY)) IN ('a','e','i','o','u');

6. Not begining with Vowels

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE CITY REGEXP "^[^aeiou]"

or

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE SUBSTRING(CITY,1,1) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u');

7. DISTINCT CITY NOT ENDNING WITH VOWELS

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE CITY REGEXP ".*[^aeiou]$"

8.Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by
 the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). 
For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. 
Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format: 
There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.


SELECT CONCAT(NAME,'(',SUBSTRING(OCCUPATION,1,1),')')
FROM OCCUPATIONS
ORDER BY NAME ASC;

select concat('There are a total of ',count(occupation),' ',lower(occupation),'s.') as total
from occupations
group by occupation
order by count(occupation)

________CITY____________
FIELD 		TYPE

COUNTRYCODE 	VARCHAR(3)
DISTRICT	VARCHAR(20)
POPULATION	NUMBER


1. SUM 
e.g Query the total population of all cities in CITY where District is California.

SELECT SUM(POPULATION)
FROM CITY
WHERE DISTRICT = 'CALIFORNIA'

e.g Query the sum of the populations for all Japanese cities in CITY. The COUNTRYCODE for Japan is JPN.

SELECT SUM(POPULATION)
FROM CITY
WHERE COUNTRYCODE = 'JPN'

2. Average
e.g Query the Average population of all cities in CITY where District is California.

SELECT AVG(POPULATION)
FROM CITY
WHERE DISTRICT = 'CALIFORNIA'

3.FLOOR
rounds downs the nearest integer
e.g -> 2.5 => 2
e.g Query the Average population of all cities in CITY round of to nearest Integer

SELECT FLOOR(AVG(POPULATION))
FROM CITY

4.CEIL
rounds Up the nearest integer
e.g -> 2.5 =>3

5. MAX AND MIN
e.g Query the difference between the maximum and minimum populations in CITY.

SELECT max(Population)-min(POPULATION)
FROM CITY

6. REPLACE
It used to Relace the perticluar character with other character

e.g ->name = 'saurabh' 
      REPLACE(name,'a','')
      at output we get 'surbh'
